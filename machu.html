<div id = "content">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMachu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments, and panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.Machu Picchu (in hispanicized spelling, Spanish pronunciation: ['mat?u 'pikt?u]) or Machu Pikchu (Quechua machu old, old person, pikchu peak; mountain or prominence with a broad base which ends in sharp peaks,[1] "old peak", pronunciation ['m?t?u 'pixt?u]) is a 15th-century Inca site located 2,430 metres (7,970 ft) above sea level.It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District in Peru. </div><br><br><br>

<div id = "content">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is situated on a mountain ridge above the Sacred Valley which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas" (a title more accurately applied to Vilcabamba), it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization.</div><br><br><br>
