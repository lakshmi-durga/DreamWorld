The Great Wall's structure changed over its 2,000 years to include higher walls, passes, signal towers and watchtowers.

The site remained unknown except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by archaeologist Hiram Bingham.

Earthquakes and stone-robbers have left the Colosseum in a state of ruin, but portions of the structure remain open to tourists, and its design still influences the construction of modern-day amphitheaters, some 2,000 years later.</p> <a href = "roman.html">More..</a></td>

Their massive scale reflects the unique role that the pharaoh, or king, played in ancient Egyptian society. Though pyramids were built from the beginning of the Old Kingdom to the close of the Ptolemaic period in the fourth century A.D., the peak of pyramid building began with the late third dynasty and continued until roughly the sixth (c. 2325 B.C.). More than 4,000 years later, the Egyptian pyramids still retain much of their majesty, providing a glimpse into the country’s rich and glorious past.</p> <a href = "pyramids.html">More..</a></td>
